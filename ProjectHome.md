Use kinect to interface with already existing games/applications.

Through the config file you can configure single or multiple physical requirements to execute single or multiple keyboard commands.

Light mouse control available currently. Will be better in short-list.

Please test out and post any issues/ideas you find. Also please be sure that your issues are understandable. :) Posting something like "it's not working right", doesn't really help anyone.

You must have the Kinect SDK from Microsoft installed in order to use this.
